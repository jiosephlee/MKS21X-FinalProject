# MKS21X-FinalProject
Final Project: Tetris

## DevLogs:
### 1/3/19
- Made the classes Grid, Tetrimino, and Piece, and started the skeleton (Joseph)
- Made a rudimentary toString for Grid, and is only showing the playing area, not the hold and the next. Made a temp toString for Piece just so the toString for Piece works. (George)
### 1/4/19
- Realized that our toString for Grid was not in the right “format” in order to include the hold and the next, so we had to rewrite it s.t. We used arrays instead of strings with \n’s. (George)
- We edited our UML diagram a bit to add some necessary params for Grid.
### 1/5/19
- Worked on toString for Grid for a tiny bit by finishing up the hold and the next string arrays. (George)
### 1/6/19
- Officially made toString for Grid and merged the branch toStringFirst and master. Waiting for Tetrimino and Piece. (George)
- Finished working on Pieces.java and figured out how Pieces will fit into Tetrimino (Joseph)
### 1/7/19
- In class, worked on translating Tetriminos and Pieces (George)
- In class, fixed the few mothods of Tetriminos and Pieces (Joseph)
- At home, worked on rotating Tetriminos by using freshman Euclidean Geometry
- At home, started figuring out the graphics using Laterna (Joseph)
